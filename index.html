     <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
     <p>Hello, welcome to my blog! My name is Vlasta Nosova. I'm 15 and I'm from Uzhhorod, Ukraine.</p>
     <p>Ok, so basically I am joking. Actually, this is not my blog >_< This site was created as a part of my school task. So, don't take it too seriously)))</p>

     <h1>A small guide on Uzhgorod</h1>

     <p></p>
     <p> If you want to know a bit about my birth town, just continue reading ^.^</p>
     <p> Uzhgorod is a veeery old town) I don't know much from its history, but I can tell that there are plenty of legends and stories about this city. Especially about the Uzhgorod castle, which is one of the most popular sights amongst tourists. These stories can tell us about people, who lived there centuries ago (of course they were kings and queens). </p>
     <p>Modern Uzhgorod still looks ancient: it is full of historical buildings and monuments. If I was asked to recommend one place to visit in Uzhgorod, I would definitely say linden alley! Not only because it is the longest alley in Europe, but also because in April you can see a lot of blooming sakura on its right side.</p>
     <p> So yeah, this was a quick guide on Uzhgorod, and I hope you enjoyed it(◕‿◕)</p>
